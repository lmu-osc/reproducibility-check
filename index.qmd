title: "Reproducibility Check"
---

Welcome to the Reproducibility Check project at the LMU Open Science Center! 
Here, we strive to increase reproducibility of scientific works
by providing guidance and services to researchers.

## What is reproducibility?

By reproducibility, we mean...

## What do we offer?

Currently, we provide guidance via a web tool
for research groups conducting peer reproductions.

In the future, we also want to provide reproducibility checks as a service.

## Who is behind this?

This project is coordinated by the [LMU Open Science Center](https://www.osc.uni-muenchen.de/).
The initial development was done by Florian Kohrt.
